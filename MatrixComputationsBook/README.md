Started by installing MinGW-w64 to compile C++

The plan is to follow the path through the book and program templates for performing matrix computations.
I've done this in C++ before with templates, so I think I'll start there.
I may be able to use this to practice python or go, but I'm positive those languages have
already efficient and effective packages for doing matrix operations.
